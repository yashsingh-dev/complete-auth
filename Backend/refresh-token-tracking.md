# 🔐 Why Tracking Used Refresh Tokens Matters

## 🔥 Why Deleting the Old Refresh Token Isn't Enough

When you delete the refresh token from the database (as you do in your current rotation logic), you are removing your ability to know:

> "Was this token just not found? Or is it a reused (stolen) token?"

So if an attacker steals a refresh token and uses it **after** you've already rotated and deleted it:

- Your server just says: “Oops, token not found — maybe expired?” and rejects the request.
- But it doesn’t know that this was a token that **used to be valid**, but is now being reused. 🚨

This means:  
❌ You miss the opportunity to detect a potential attack.

## ✅ What Tracking Used Tokens Gives You

If you keep the old token in the DB with a flag like `isUsed = true`, then when the attacker tries to reuse it:

- You find it in DB.
- You check: `isUsed === true` → boom 💥 → Token reuse detected.
- Now you know: "This user might be under attack."
- → You can log out all devices, alert the user, block IP, etc.

This is exactly what systems like Google and GitHub do.

## 🔐 Let's Simulate It

Assume:

- You log in → receive refresh token A
- Then you refresh → get refresh token B, and delete A

Now imagine:

- Attacker steals A and sends it to your `/refresh` endpoint

❌ In your current flow:

- Token A is deleted from DB → not found → 403 → done.
- But you don't know this was a reuse attempt

✅ In improved flow:

- Token A is in DB, but marked `isUsed = true`
- Attacker tries using A → you find it and see: it's already used → 🧠 someone is reusing a token!
- → Security response: logout everywhere, maybe lock account, send warning email

## 💡 Summary

| Action                          | With Just Delete | With `isUsed` Flag |
|---------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Detect token reuse attack       | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Invalidate all tokens safely    | ❌               | ✅                 |
| Notify user on suspicious use   | ❌               | ✅                 |

So: tracking old refresh tokens (just for a short time) is not about "still using them" — it’s about **detecting reuse**. Think of it like a trap: once used, it should never come back. If it does → danger 🚨.
